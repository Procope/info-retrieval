    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support.

Hence, the tfidf model, which does not discount probability mass by smoothing as all the other techniques do, gives an advantage to highly frequent words. It is also worth pointing out that the plm modelis the second highest scoring one, which can be again explained by the same pattern as in query 18 but this time for the tokens \"u\" and \"s\".\n",

We are thinking that some subsets of this query occur often within the same passage and therefore documents are retrieved that only contain information relative to this subset."

An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",

In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
