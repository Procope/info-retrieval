    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support.

    "    - [Positional Language Models](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/~ylv2/pub/sigir09-plm.pdf) define a language model for each position of a document, and score a document based on the scores of its PLMs. The PLM is estimated based on propagated counts of words within a document through a proximity-based density function, which both captures proximity heuristics and achieves an effect of “soft” passage retrieval. Implement the PLM, all five kernels, but only the Best position strategy to score documents. Use 𝛔 equal to 50, and Dirichlet smoothing with 𝛍 optimized on the validation set (decide how to optimize this value yourself and motivate your decision in the report). **[10 points]**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Implement the above methods and report evaluation measures (on the test set) using the hyper parameter values you optimized on the validation set (also report the values of the hyper parameters). Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the language models, create plots showing `NDCG@10` with varying values of the parameters. You can do this by chaining small scripts using shell scripting (preferred) or execute trec_eval using Python's `subprocess`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute significance of the results using a [two-tailed paired Student t-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) **[5 points]**. Be wary of false rejection of the null hypothesis caused by the [multiple comparisons problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem). There are multiple ways to mitigate this problem and it is up to you to choose one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse the results by identifying specific queries where different methods succeed or fail and discuss possible reasons that cause these differences. This is *very important* in order to understand who the different retrieval functions behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Don’t forget to use log computations in your calculations to avoid underflows. "

    "\n",
    "You do not need to implement LSI or LDA on your own. Instead, you can use [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html). An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a latent semantic model for retrieval, you need to:\n",
    "   * build a representation of the query **q**,\n",
    "   * build a representation of the document **d**,\n",
    "   * calculate the similarity between **q** and **d** (e.g., cosine similarity, KL-divergence).\n",
    "     \n",
    "The exact implementation here depends on the latent semantic model you are using. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Each of these LSMs come with various hyperparameters to tune. Make a choice on the parameters, and explicitly mention the reasons that led you to these decisions. You can use the validation set to optimize hyper parameters you see fit; motivate your decisions. In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you will first obtain an initial top-1000 ranking for each query using TF-IDF in **Task 1**, and then re-rank the documents using the LSMs. Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",
